# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.\
For PawPal+, I identified three main actions that users should be able to perform.\
First, a user should be able to add and manage pets. Since the system is focused on pet care, each owner needs a way to store information about their pets, such as the pet’s name, type, age, and other basic details.\
Second, a user should be able to schedule and track pet care tasks. These tasks may include feeding, walking, giving medication, or attending vet appointments. Each task should belong to a specific pet and include useful details such as date, time, priority, and whether it repeats.\
Third, a user should be able to view and organize daily tasks. The system should help owners quickly understand what needs to be done today by displaying tasks in a clear order, such as by time or priority. It should also support logic for identifying overlapping or conflicting tasks.

- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?\
The initial UML design for PawPal+ focuses on four main classes: Owner, Pet, Task, and Scheduler. These classes represent the core components needed to manage pet care routines.

The **Owner** class represents the user of the system. It is responsible for storing basic owner information and maintaining a list of pets that belong to the owner. This allows the system to organize pet care tasks under a specific user.

The **Pet** class represents an individual pet. Each pet belongs to an owner and contains information such as the pet's name, type, and age. The Pet class also manages a list of tasks related to that pet, such as feeding, walking, or medication.

The **Task** class represents a care activity that needs to be performed for a pet. A task contains details such as the task name, scheduled time, priority level, and whether it repeats. This class is responsible for storing and updating task information.

The **Scheduler** class manages the organization of tasks. It is responsible for sorting tasks by time or priority, detecting scheduling conflicts, and retrieving tasks for a specific day. This class acts as the logic layer that helps keep the pet care schedule organized.

Together, these classes create a modular structure where owners manage pets, pets manage tasks, and the scheduler ensures tasks are organized efficiently.

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?\
Yes
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.\
After reviewing my class skeleton with AI, I made an important design refinement to reduce ambiguity in task management. Initially, both the Pet class and the Scheduler class had responsibility for adding and storing tasks. This created a duplication problem because it was unclear whether tasks should live inside each pet or inside the scheduler.

To fix this, I made Pet the single source of truth for task storage. Each pet now owns its own list of tasks, and tasks are added through the Pet class. I updated the Scheduler design so that it works with a list of pets instead of maintaining a separate flat task list. This makes the Scheduler responsible only for organizing, sorting, and checking conflicts across pet tasks, rather than storing them.

I made this change because it creates a clearer separation of responsibilities, reduces data duplication, and makes conflict detection more meaningful by allowing tasks to be grouped by pet.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

My scheduler considers several basic constraints when organizing pet care tasks. The main constraint is **scheduled time**, because tasks need to happen in a clear order throughout the day. It also considers **priority**, so more important tasks such as feeding, medication, or vet visits can be ranked above less urgent tasks. In addition, the scheduler uses **status** to separate pending tasks from completed ones, and it supports **frequency** so recurring daily or weekly tasks can automatically generate their next occurrence.

I decided that time and priority mattered most because they have the biggest impact on how a pet owner plans daily care. A task that is urgent but scheduled later still needs attention, while tasks that happen earlier should appear in the correct chronological order. Status and recurrence were also important, but they mainly support organization rather than deciding the main task order.

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

AI tools were used throughout the project to support different stages of development. I used AI primarily for brainstorming the system design, generating initial class structures, debugging errors, and improving code readability. During the design phase, AI helped suggest how to structure the Owner, Pet, Task, and Scheduler classes and how those classes should interact.

AI was also useful when writing tests and understanding error messages. For example, when debugging Streamlit session state issues or pytest failures, I asked AI to explain why the error occurred and how to correct the logic.

The most helpful prompts were clear and specific questions such as:
- "Where should this logic be placed in my code?"
- "Why is this test failing?"
- "How should I structure this scheduler method?"

These kinds of targeted prompts helped generate useful suggestions without introducing unnecessary complexity.

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

he automated tests focused on verifying the core behaviors of the scheduling system. These included:

- Task completion behavior to ensure marking a task complete correctly updates its status.
- Pet task management to confirm that tasks can be added to pets and stored properly.
- Sorting logic to verify that tasks are returned in chronological order when sorted by scheduled time.
- Recurrence handling to ensure that completing a daily recurring task generates the next occurrence.
- Conflict detection to confirm that the scheduler identifies tasks scheduled at the same time.

These tests were important because they verify that the scheduler behaves correctly under normal usage and that the core logic remains stable as the system evolves.

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

The part of the project I am most satisfied with is the overall system architecture. Separating the logic into Owner, Pet, Task, and Scheduler classes made the code easier to understand and maintain. This structure also allowed the scheduling logic to remain independent from the Streamlit UI.

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

If I had another iteration, I would improve the scheduling algorithm by supporting overlapping task durations and more advanced prioritization. I would also refine the Streamlit interface to include editing tasks, deleting tasks, and visualizing schedules in a more interactive way.

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?

One important takeaway from this project is that AI tools are powerful assistants, but the developer still needs to guide the design and verify the results. Acting as the lead architect ensures that AI-generated suggestions align with the intended system structure and project goals. This approach helps maintain clean design, reliable functionality, and meaningful use of AI support.
